When it comes to streaming user actions to your Mixpanel project, there are a few different approaches to consider. Each has pros and cons depending on the type of data you need to collect, your tolerance for data reliability, and the ease of implementation.

## Client-Side Tracking

Under this method, the tracking payload (e.g. a Mixpanel event) is generated on the client device and sent directly to you the Mixpanel API. If you are using any of our client-side SDKs with the default configurations, this is how you're sending data.

#### Pros
- Easy to track client-side actions and state
- Easiest to setup
- Requires no additional infrastructure
- Our client-side SDKs make it easy to:
    - track anonymous (non-logged in) users across requests
    - persist property values across requests (what we call Super Properties)

#### Cons 
- API requests are often blocked by Ad Blockers
- Difficult to keep metrics consistent across platforms
- Difficult to fix integration mistakes quickly (particularly on mobile applications)

## Client-Side Tracking with a Proxy

Under this method, the tracking payload (e.g. a Mixpanel event) is generated on the client device and sent to your own server first which relays it to you the Mixpanel API. You can configure all of our client-side SDKs to send data to your proxy server. See [Collection via a proxy](doc:self-hosted-tracking) for more details.

#### Pros
- Easy to track client-side actions and state
- Less susceptible to being blocked by Ad Blockers
- Grants you more control of the data you're sending to your Mixpanel project (filtering, cleaning, etc)
- Our client-side SDKs make it easy to:
    - track anonymous (non-logged in) users across requests
    - persist property values across requests (what we call Super Properties)

#### Cons 
- Requires some additional infrastructure
- Difficult to keep metrics consistent across platforms
- Difficult to fix integration mistakes quickly (particularly on mobile applications)

## Server-Side Tracking

Under this method, the tracking payload (e.g. a Mixpanel event) is generated by your server and sent to the Mixpanel API as a part of your _natural application flow_. For example, when a user loads a web page a request is made to your web application server. In the code that handles the request you can create a "Page loaded" event and send it to your Mixpanel project from your server.

#### Pros
- Not susceptible to Ad Blockers
- Data is consistent across platforms
- Easier to fix integration mistakes quickly
- Requires no additional infrastructure


#### Cons 
- Harder to track client-side actions and state
- Requires some custom code to: 
    - track anonymous (non-logged in) users across requests
    - persist property values across requests (what we call Super Properties)

## Which Should I Use?

**TL;DR: For the best data quality, Server-Side > Client-Side with Proxy > Client-Side**

The best implementations we see employ a hybrid approach to maximize data quality while maintaining the flexibility to easily collect the metrics they need. When evaluating how to track a particular metric, we suggest starting with "Server-Side Tracking" and only move to either of the "Client-Side" approaches if it's not possible to collect purely server-side. This can be the case if you need to track interactions with your product that don't result in any natural server requests (such as a button click that opens a modal). For this type of data, we recommend the "Client-Side Tracking With Proxy" approach as it gives you more control over your data pipeline and helps prevent data loss due to Ad Blockers.
