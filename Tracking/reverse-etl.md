If you use a Reverse ETL tool like Census or Hightouch, you can send event, user, and account data from your data warehouse to Mixpanel with just a few lines of SQL. This helps you get setup with Mixpanel quickly on data you already have.

See our documentation for [Census](https://docs.getcensus.com/destinations/mixpanel) and [HighTouch](https://hightouch.com/docs/destinations/mixpanel) for more information on how to get set up.
