Mixpanel Boards and reports can be embedded in Figma, Coda, Jira, and any third-party tool that supports embedding.

## Using Embeds




## Supporting Embeds in your Platform

### oEmbed
oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third-party sites. It’s a way to embed content from one website onto another website without having to manually copy and paste code.

If your platform supports the oEmbed format, you should be able to support Mixpanel’s Embeddable reports right out of the box. For more information on implementing oEmbed, you can read more here.

### Embedly or Iframely
If you don’t currently support oEmbed, Embedly or Iframely are platforms that can help you get started.

Embedly provides a way to embed content from a variety of sources, including YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud, and more. It offers an API that developers can use to embed content on their websites. Embedly also offers a variety of tools and features, including the ability to customize the appearance of embedded content.

Iframely is a similar service to Embedly. It helps websites and applications embed external content such as videos, images, articles, and more. It simplifies the process of embedding content by automatically generating embed codes for various media sources, eliminating the need for developers to manually code each embed.
