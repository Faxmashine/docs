We’ve revamped Custom Alerts to make it easier for you to notify your team when a metric significantly changes.

With just one click, you can set up Slack or email alerts for:

- When an important metric reaches a target, such as if "sign-ups" in "Japan" reaches 1000
- Monitoring unexpected behavior (or potentially faulty data), such as when any event in any segment changes by more than 25%

As a bonus, we’ve also improved admin controls so that you can better organize your workspace through bulk deletion and clearer invalid alert symbols.



## Explore new questions with Custom Buckets

Introducing **Custom Buckets**, a super simple way to group existing breakdowns to form meaningful segments. This added power can help you explore new, complex questions about your product usage by slicing & dicing like never before - all on the fly in an easy-to-use interface. Here are a few types of analysis you can build with Custom Buckets:

**Age Cohorts:** Group an age breakdown to determine how a new feature has affected a key usage metric for different generations (Gen Z = ages 18-26, Millennial = ages 27-41) since last month.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2023-03-28-custom-buckets1.png)

**Channel Source:** Group all social channel segments into a single value (Social Media Channels = Facebook + Instagram + Twitter) to determine if your investment in social is driving signups.

## Calculate retention based on a calendar interval

Our new Calendar Retention setting allows our users to define retention on their own terms - now, you can switch your retention calculations from a rolling time window to calendar interval in just one click. Whether you want to align your retention data to internal records or other analysis tools, you can now create a reliable retention analysis that you and your team can trust to be accurate with your business’s needs.

You might enjoy Calendar Retention if:

- Your app or service has one engagement a day, so you want to capture the daily sessions that fall outside of the 24-hour window but occur on the next calendar day.
- There’s a marketing campaign running week-to-week, so you can scale weekly marketing spend based on calendar week retention increasing or decreasing.
- You need to align your retention metric to a monthly or quarterly calendar interval when sharing out retention performance to investors.

Please checkout our help document if you would like to learn more on how to use Calendar Retention.

## View Users now available in Flows & more charts

Back in March of 2022, we upgraded Mixpanel’s user insights analysis with View Users - a simple way to discover who’s contributing to a point on a chart or metric. Since then, Mixpanelers have leveraged this feature to learn more about their users who are driving product growth or stagnation.

With so many people enjoying the power of View Users, we’re excited to bring this functionality to additional areas of Mixpanel:

- **Flows report**
- **Trends Chart** in Funnels, Retention, and Retention Frequency report
- **Frequency Chart** in Funnels report
- **Top Paths Chart** in Funnels report
- **Time To Convert Chart** in Funnels report
- **Metric Chart** in Insights and Funnels report
- **Pie Chart** in Insights report

![changelog Image](/changelog-2023-01-23-users-flows.png)


## Add your Insights Table to Boards

If you’re a fan of visualizing data in table format, you can now save your table to a Board and preserve your analysis. To leverage this new capability, simply add a table to your Board or switch an existing Insights chart into its table format.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2023-01-18-table-boards1.png)

## Other Updates

URLs are meant to be short and sweet - now, sharing your Mixpanel analysis is super easy with shortened URLs supported on all reports and Boards. 


## Collaboration just got easier with Boards

We’re excited to introduce Mixpanel Boards, a new collaborative workspace that replaces our existing dashboards. Unlike an inflexible dashboard that only shows product metrics, Boards empowers teams to share complete context, dig into the data, and make better product decisions together. **What's included in Boards:**
- **Text cards:** Add text to share the reasoning behind tracking any metric (with support for rich text formatting!)
- **Media cards:** Give more color with a screenshot or feature walkthrough with YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom, or just spice things up with great memes
- **Adjustable card height and width:** Insert, drag, and resize cards to make your analyses more organized and readable
- **Viewer transparency:** Hover over the top right corner to quickly see who has recently viewed your Board, so you can know your impact

## Mixed Improvements in Mixpanel

[Perfecting Mixpanel’s workflows are a top priority for us](https://mixpanel.com/blog/mixpanel-product-polish-updates-user-friction/), and that’s why our customers appreciate our best-in-class design when answering their everyday product questions. We take pride in focusing on the small, but vital incremental improvements that help Mixpanel become faster, more intuitive, and an overall joyous experience for our users.

This month, we’re introducing our **Mixed Improvements**: updates that enhance Mixpanel’s workflows and upgrade your product analytics experience.

**Query builder refinements**

- Report tabs have been adjusted and color-coded to help you easily recognize where you are during an analysis.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-12-01-improvements1.gif)


- The query builder is much easier to scan, all thanks to the new way of adding event and cohort blocks via the header of each section.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-12-01-improvements2.gif)


- Query blocks feel super reactive with their new design that reflects all the possible states they can be in.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-12-01-improvements3.jpeg)


- Headers, like **Event & Cohorts**, stick to the top so you don’t have to scroll back up to add other query blocks.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-12-01-improvements4.gif)


- We’ve added arrow controls for a quicker way to input your number of steps in Flows report.

- Dragging and dropping query blocks that are partially populated (uncompleted) is now possible across the query builder.

## Other updates

- Flows report has been made even more intuitive - hover over a path to find the percent of users who performed that next step, and left-click on an event to pull up the action menu.

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-12-01-improvements5.gif)

- Dashboards feel quicker than ever now that loading times for report editing in a Dashboard have decreased considerably.

- Build and rebuild your Dashboards faster than ever with supported Undo (⌘+Z) & Redo (Shift+⌘+Z).

- Render optimizations to data tables have helped them feel snappier and scroll much smoother.

- All dates in Mixpanel have been streamlined to one format, for example, _Thu Jul 14, 2022 7:00 AM_.


## Accurate Event Ordering with Millisecond Precision

Say hello to accurate event ordering with Millisecond Precision. Now, even if you have multiple events happening within the same second, Mixpanel has the power to decipher the exact sequence in which those events occurred.

Check out any Flows report to view millisecond level of precision firsthand!

**Before you can view events at Millisecond Precision, please make a note of two key points:**

1. You need to update your SDK to ingest events with millisecond timestamps. All previous versions only track at second precision. The _minimum versions_ that support _ms_ time stamps are as follows: 
- Swift - 3.3.0
- Obj-C - 4.2.0
- Android - 6.3.0
- Flutter - 1.6.0
- React Native - 1.5.0 
- Unity - 3.3.0
- Javascript - historical versions have already been tracking ms timestamp. No action is to be taken if using this SDK.

>Note: If you are sending data into Mixpanel via a CDP or the DWH, no change is required at your end if you’re already tracking data at ms precision.

2. Only forward-looking data will be tracked at ms precision. This means that once you update your SDK, it will take some time to accumulate data with ms precision before you can see it reflected in your analysis.


## Sessions improvements and new functionality 

We’ve added two updates to session tracking in Mixpanel for more flexibility when defining your sessions and a simpler process to slice and dice this data. With Property Based Sessions and Sessions Properties, you can take advantage of a whole new way to analyze how users engage with your product:

- **Property-Based Sessions:** have your own parameters that define a session? No worries - simply attach a Session ID property to your events, and Mixpanel will register all instances when a session starts and ends. Even if your sessions are complex — start from multiple events, have a max duration of 6 hours, and end after 30 minutes of inactivity — Property-Based Sessions can manage these parameters.

- **Session Properties:** borrow any property from the events that define a Session Start or Session End to break down your user engagement data like never before.

For example, you can now set the property “City” to your session events to compare how users across different cities start and end sessions as well as the duration of these sessions.


## Reorient your view of charts and tables

Mixpanel’s charts and tables both provide a unique way to view data and capture insights. But, sometimes you’re only in need of the table. Or, you need both the chart and table for a holistic analysis. That’s why we’ve introduced **Layout Controls** and **Visual Grouped** Sort to give you control over the orientation of your report. 

## Layout Controls

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-07-08-reorient1.gif)

We’ve added three buttons to give you control over the viewable area of your charts and tables:

1. Chart Focus: expand your chart so it is the only focus
2. Split View: split screen between both your chart and table
3. Table Focus: hide the chart completely to view the full, uncollapsed table
4. 
Now, you don’t have to scroll around trying to find the most relevant data view. Simply click your desired orientation and voila - the perfect view is automatically adjusted. Otherwise, you can drag the dividing handle to your preferred destination.

## Visual Grouped Sort

![changelog Image](/changelog-2022-07-08-reorient2.gif)

Across all reports, data tables now include hierarchal structures that reduce repetitive information. This update makes it easier to group together the same metric so you can compare the results side-by-side. Checkout the before and after:

### Before

### After

## Uncover user insights with View Users

Making sense of your data just got a whole lot easier. In just two clicks, you can now View Users contributing to any event, at any point in time, across Insights, Funnels, and Retention reports. Save this list as a cohort. Export it as a CSV. And just like that, you have the data to find groups of users experiencing friction or dig deeper into what specific users are driving feature adoption. You can expect View Users to help:

**Learn what type of users are driving growth or stagnation:** Each user’s properties and recent activities are readily accessible in View Users. This makes uncovering user themes fast - plus, you don’t have to leave the context of your Mixpanel report for this deep level of exploration. 

**Take action on a group of users:** View Users also helps with turning discoveries into actionable next steps. For example, you can leverage the Export to CSV button to grab the emails of a specific user group and plug them into an email campaign. Then, save that same group as a cohort in order to track their product usage after you send an email.


## Faster Workflows for Speedy Report Building

Undo mistakes, shift query blocks and switch reports with lightning speed. Now, Mixpanel workflows are even faster with tools to quickly build, rebuild, and explore your reports.

**Undo / Redo**
We’ve added shortcuts to make iterating between changes in your analysis blazingly fast. Cmd + Z to undo; Cmd + Shift + Z to redo. Change filters, date ranges, line vs bar chart, and go back in one second to compare before and after, or fix the view. Speed is the only constant.

**Drag & Drop Query Blocks**

Save valuable time by dragging and dropping an existing query block into a different section. Want to change your breakdown by cities into a filter by those same cities? Click and drag your query block from the breakdown section, place it into the filter section, and voila - no need to recreate your queries, simply drag and drop existing ones.

**Fluid Report Transitions**

Realized you can find the answer to your question in a different report? No worries - Fluid Report Transitions preserves the parameters of your original question for quick, stress-free report switching. Start in Insights and switch into Funnels, then into Flows, and back to Insights all while keeping the events, filters, breakdowns and date ranges you set originally - zero rebuilding required.


## Improved conversion analysis in Flows

We’ve boosted Flows so you can better see which actions affect conversion. You can seamlessly switch from Funnels to Flows now, carrying over criteria like excluded steps, and you can break down paths by conversion & drop-off — all in a single, smooth visualization.

## Clarify context with more Lexicon support

You can now use Lexicon descriptions for group profile properties, helping you add more context to your metrics. No more guesswork about what a property means.

## Measure performance better with relative comparisons

With our improved relative comparisons, you can now calculate & visualize metrics for specific segments relative to others. We’ve also enhanced time comparisons, adding visualizations like c

## Tell a richer story with text on dashboards

You can now add text to dashboards, making it easier to share the context behind your analysis or tell a compelling story around your data. Sometimes, a word is worth a thousand pictures.
