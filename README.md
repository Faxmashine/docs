If you see something off with our docs (typo, broken link, outdated content/screenshot) you can now propose that change yourself!

Our live docs live [here](https://developer.mixpanel.com/v3.19). 

# Contributing Fixes
You’ll need a Github account. It’s free and takes 1 minute to create. Not sure what to make your handle? We recommend yourfullname-mixpanel. 

To make an edit: 
* Go to the file you want to edit. Our directory structure roughly matches the hierarchy in ReadMe.
* Click the pencil icon to make edits to a file’s the markdown. You can swap between code and preview to see what your edits look like.
* When you’re ready, hit “Commit” and follow the instructions to commit the changes to your branch and create a pull request review. Add a description if you like, keeping in mind that this is publicly accessible. 
* Github will post a message in Slack with a link to your review. One of the docs maintainers will approve and merge that request within 1 day (usually faster if it’s a small change). 

# Fixing Images
All images/gifs also live in Github under the media/ folder. Updating an image takes 2 steps:
* First, make a commit which uploads the new image or images to the media folder. 
* Second, make the change to the doc to link to that new image. 
* You should do both of these commits to the same branch, so that they can be reviewed and merged together. 

# Adding new docs / changing structure
These are currently not possible purely in Github, due to a limitation of the ReadMe <> Github integration. Keep in mind that creating new docs takes time and can add more clutter to our docs if not done carefully… so we expect adding net new docs to be rare. 

if you think we need a new doc (eg: because we’re shipping a new feature or adding a how to), create an issue. We’ll discuss in Github and one of the doc maintainers will create the doc in ReadMe if we decide it’s necessary. Once it’s created, you can then make a pull request to write up the contents of the doc, going through the normal workflow as outlined in the “Contributing fixes” section. 

# Who are the maintainers?
Vijay, Marissa, Seams, Mav. Eventually we’ll expand this list, but keeping it tight for now.
