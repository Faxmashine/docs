First, we'll connect Mixpanel and Freshpaint so these apps can easily communicate.

In your **Mixpanel* project, grab your [Project Token](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004490503-Project-Settings#project-token) and [API Secret](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004490503-Project-Settings#api-secret) in **project settings → overview**
